# Shipt-Economic-Analysis
Analyses and recommendations for Shipt business operations given the high inflationary environment in the current economy

## About

My team partnered with Shipt, a grocery delivery gig company, to provide them with recommendations on how to improve their operations given contemporary economic constraints. Specifically, the question we aimed to answer was "what are limits for a growth of a grocery delivery company and constraints in the current environment around its operations?" My job was to perform the statistical analyses to find the effects of gas prices on the number of orders on Shipt's platform, using Uber data scraped online as a proxy for Shipt and the gig economy.
